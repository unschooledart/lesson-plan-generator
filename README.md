## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine for development:

1.  Ensure you have all project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `database.js`) in the same folder.
2.  Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3.  Install the **"Live Server"** extension (by Ritwick Dey).
4.  Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server". This will open the project in your browser and handle any local server requirements.
